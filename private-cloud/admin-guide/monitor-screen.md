# Monitor large screen
The monitoring screen is a cloud platform resource visualization large screen provided by the platform for enterprises. It mainly displays the monitoring data in the macro dimension of the platform, helping enterprise cloud platform operators to quickly understand the overall operation of the platform. It supports custom drag-and-drop modules and full-screen display, which is convenient. The administrator performs split-screen management. Users can enter the monitoring screen page through the button on the left side of the administrator's avatar, as shown in the following figure:
