# 13. One-click Inspection

##  13.1 Introduction to One-click Inspection

### 13.1.1 Overview

One-click inspection is used to check the health status of the cloud platform. By scanning the inspection items of the management node and compute node, including the CPU, memory, disk usage, etc. of platform nodes, it makes it easier for administrators to evaluate problems.

### 13.1.2 Content of One-click Inspection

Inspection mainly scans the entire platform, including time source synchronization check of the management node, CPU usage rate check, memory usage rate check, and disk usage rate check; physical machine CPU average usage check, physical machine memory usage rate check, physical machine system disk used capacity check of the compute node, etc. The contents of one-click inspection are as follows:

| Inspection Type | Inspection Item                                  | Meaning                                                                                         | Meaning                                                                                                                           | Inspection Suggestion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
