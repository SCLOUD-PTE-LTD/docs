# 9 Financial Management

## 9.1 Overview

Billing management provides users with metering and billing services for resource allocation and usage. All billable resources support three billing methods: hourly, monthly, and yearly, and support order management operations such as billing, deduction, renewal, and expiration recovery. Transactions such as account top-up and deduction are also provided based on the account. Sub-accounts share the main account balance, and resources created through sub-accounts can be directly deducted from the shared balance, and transaction details and order information can be viewed through the main account or sub-account.

Platform resource billing is pre-paid, which means that regardless of whether you pay hourly, monthly, or yearly, you need to ensure that your account balance can cover the fees for one billing cycle when creating resources, and the fees will be deducted at the beginning of the next billing cycle.

- Hourly billing: Each hour is a billing cycle, and resources are pre-charged based on the hourly rate.
- Monthly billing: Each month (non-calendar month) is a billing cycle, and resources are pre-charged based on the monthly rate.
- Yearly billing: Each year (rolling year) is a billing cycle, and resources are pre-charged based on the yearly rate.

> Resources purchased annually or monthly support upgrading/downgrading configurations at any time and automatically fill in the price difference after upgrading.

When the account balance is insufficient for the next billing cycle, the resource will automatically enter the recycling bin and can only be restored after renewing the resource account and resource. For resources that are not entered into the recycle bin upon deletion, if the account balance is insufficient for the next billing cycle, the resource will automatically enter the expired state and will be deleted automatically after 7 days.

If the cloud platform administrator globally enables **Resource Auto-renewal** and **the account balance is sufficient**, resources will be automatically renewed in the next billing cycle. If the cloud platform administrator globally disables **Resource Auto-renewal** and **the account balance is sufficient**, resources will automatically enter the recycle bin in the next billing cycle and need to be renewed and restored in the recycling bin.

When creating resources, all billing prices for billing resources will be displayed by the resource pricing tool based on the billing method to confirm the cost of the order. When the account balance is insufficient, managers can top up the account.

The platform provides administrators with complete financial management capabilities, including order management, transaction management, top-up management, and price configuration.

- Order Management: View all order records generated on the platform, or customize query time periods to query order records.

## 9.5 Price Configuration

### 9.5.1 Overview

Price configuration refers to the global product pricing on the platform. The platform supports pricing for 5 dimensions of resource items, including CPU, memory, disk, public network IP, and GPU. The actual selling price of a single cloud service is accumulated based on the billing resource items involved in the cloud service. Tenant prices inherit the prices in the price configuration by default and can be customized by administrators to adjust to the needs of platform operation.

| Resource Item     | Billing Type            | Billing Rule                                                                                 |
|-------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CPU               | Hourly, Monthly, Yearly | Price per core CPU per cluster                                                               |
| Memory            | Hourly, Monthly, Yearly | Price per GB per cluster                                                                     |
| Disk              | Hourly, Monthly, Yearly | Price per GB per cluster                                                                     |
| Public Network IP | Hourly, Monthly, Yearly | Price per Mb per segment. Different bandwidth gradients can be defined with different prices |
| GPU               | Hourly, Monthly, Yearly | Price per GPU per cluster                                                                    |

When the platform is initialized, initial pricing will be done for all billing items. If changes are needed, they can be adjusted in the Management Platform/Operations and Management/Price Configuration. If the platform does not need billing, the prices for all billing items can be set to 0.

### 9.5.2 View Price Configuration

Administrators can view the price information of all products (billing resources) under each region on the current platform through the price configuration console, including billing factors, attributes, billing types, billing rules, prices, units, creation time, update time, and operation items.

![price](/assets/images/adminguide/price.png)

### 9.5.3 Modify Global Benchmark Price

Administrators can configure the global benchmark price of each billing resource item at the global price configuration. After the price is modified, the resource item price will be changed globally; The discount rate set by the tenant will not change, but the final discounted price will change with the tenant's discount rate.

* After the hourly benchmark pricing of a global resource item is updated, services paid by the hour will be charged based on the new benchmark price in the next billing cycle.
* After the monthly or yearly benchmark pricing of a global resource item is updated, there will be no impact on the services that have already been paid for by the month or year. They will be charged based on the new benchmark price in the next billing cycle.

The administrator can update the price of billing resources on the global price configuration list and set the base price for a single resource item for different clusters. For example, the following figure shows how to modify the hourly payment benchmark price of CPU in the `ComputeSetAAAA`  cluster:

![upcpuprice](/assets/images/adminguide/upcpuprice.png)

The administrator can modify the base price for each billing resource item. In the above figure, taking virtual machine CPU as an example, the hourly price of a single-core vCPU can be set at 0.2431 yuan, indicating that the hourly unit price of a single-core vCPU is 0.2431 yuan. At the same time, the platform supports tiered pricing based on the external IP address range, as shown in the figure below:

![bgpprice](/assets/images/adminguide/bgpprice.png)

The administrator can set tiered pricing for external network segment (such as the Bgp segment in the above figure) IP bandwidth, where the global benchmark price for 0M~5M is 1 yuan, and that for 5M~99999999M is 10 yuan, thus improving the maintainability of the platform billing.
