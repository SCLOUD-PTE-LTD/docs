# Quick start
## Get to know APIs
SCloud API adopts an instructional style, and each API request includes an instruction (Action), instruction parameters and authentication information (PublicKey, Signature).

### Common parameters
Public parameters are parameters that must be given when operating all APIs, and are usually displayed at the top of all parameters in the API documentation.

| Parameter name | Type |  | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Action | string | The corresponding API instruction name, the current API is `DescribeUHostInstance` | Yes |
| PublicKey | string | The user's public key, available from [Console](https://console.scloud.sg/uaccount/api_manage) fetch | Yes |
| Signature | string | According to the public key and API The user signature generated by the directive is found in [Signature algorithm](https://docs.scloud.sg/api/common/signature-algorithm) | Yes |

### General parameters
General parameters are parameters that may be used by most APIs and have consistent meanings. Whether they need to be given or not depends on the definition of the specific API.

| The parameter name | Type | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Region | string | [See List of Regions and Availability Zones](https://docs.scloud.sg/api/common/region-and-zone) | Yes |
| Zone | string | [See List of Regions and Availability Zones](https://docs.scloud.sg/api/common/region-and-zone) | Yes |
| ProjectId | string | Project ID (example: `org-04ibqy`), This field, by default, is empty and is only required when the account is a Sub-Account | No |

### Public Response
The public response is a response style uniformly followed by all APIs, including an instruction response name (Action), a status code (RetCode) to identify whether the API is successful, and an error message (Message) returned when an error is encountered.

| Field name | Type | Describe | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RetCode | int | Returns a status code, with `0` for success and failure for `non-0` | Yes |
| Action | string | The name of the operation instruction | Yes |
| Message | string | Returns an error message that provides detailed description information when RetCode is non-0 | No |
| ULHostId | string | Instance ID | Yes |

### Error Code Description

| RetCode | Description | 
| -- | -- |
| 110 | API response timed out (60 seconds) | 
| 130 | API gateway or authentication service exception |
| 150 | The service is currently unavailable, we are working hard to restore it, please try again later |
| 153 | API requests are limited |
| 160 | The key parameter Action is missing, please provide complete parameters |
| 161 | Action does not exist |
| 170 | Missing signature |
| 171 | Signature error |
| 172 | User does not exist |
| 174 | Token does not exist |
| 292 | Item does not exist |
| 293 | Availability zone permission error |
| 294 | Access to IP is denied |
| 295 | Security lock verification failed |
| 299 | IAM permission verification failed |

## Quick start
### Preparation
1. Get the API access address
2. Get the API key, including PublicKey and PrivateKey, from the UAPI console
3. If the resource to be operated belongs to a certain region, obtain the list of regions and availability zones
4. If the account belongs to a sub-account, or needs to operate a specific project, get the project ID

### Make a request
You can initiate requests to the API access address in various ways, including clients such as cURL and Postman, as well as UAPI browsers, CLIs, SDKs, etc. It is recommended to use a UAPI browser. After the request is constructed and initiated, the SDK sample can be automatically generated.

SCloud API supports two methods of GET / POST, and two request methods of application/json and application/x-www-form-urlencoded.

This article takes cURL POST JSON as an example to describe how to construct and initiate an HTTP request.

> Data assumptions

In this example assume: 

```
PublicKey  = 'john.doe@example.com1296235120854146120'
PrivateKey = '46f09bb9fab4f12dfc160dae12273d5332b5debe'
```

Suppose the user request parameters are as follows:

```
{
    "Action"     :  "DescribeUHostInstance",
    "Region"     :  "vn-sng",
    "Limit"      :  10
}
```
Calculate signature

Refer to the [signature algorithm document](https://docs.scloud.sg/api/common/signature-algorithm), the calculated Signature is `52fc1191f026532c9100946c6a863a90d5f766ed`.

Construct request

Fill in the `PublicKey` and `Signature` into the request parameters, and the constructed request is finally:

```
curl -X POST \
  https://api.scloud.sg \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
      "Action"     :  "DescribeUHostInstance",
      "Limit"      :  10,
      "PublicKey"  :  "john.doe@example.com1296235120854146120",
      "Region"     :  "vn-sng",
      "Signature"  :  "52fc1191f026532c9100946c6a863a90d5f766ed"
  }'
```
