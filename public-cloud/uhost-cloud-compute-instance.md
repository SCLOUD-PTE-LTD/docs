# 1.1 UHost Cloud Compute Instance

SCloud UHost is based on mature cloud computing technology, high-performance infrastructure, high-quality network bandwidth, high-quality data center and other resources. It provides safe and stable, fast deployment, flexible expansion, and convenient management computing unit.

## 1.1.1 Cloud Instance Type

UHost are divided into four types according to the application scenarios: Outstanding (O), Standard (N), High Frequency (C).

|         | Features          | Applicable scene |
|:-------------|:------------------|:------|
| Outstanding (O) | The latest generation of cloud host with excellent computing, storage and network performance. Latest Intel Cascade Lake and AMD EPYC2 processor | Database, MMO games, artificial intelligence, etc. |
| Standard (N) | Flexible configuration & Great Choices   | Enterprise-level applications, memory services, data analysis, etc. |
| High Frequency (C) | Adopts 3.2GHz CPU with strong computing performance | High frequency trading, data processing, graphics rendering, etc. |

Summary of basic parameters of cloud instance:

|  | Standard N	| High Frequency C | Outstanding O |
|:-------------|:-------------|:------------------|:------|
| CPU: Memory |	1:1-1:8 |	1:1-1:8 |	1:1-1:8 |
| CPU Type	| IvyBridge/Haswell/Broadwell/Skylake |	Skylake (models with main frequency â‰¥3.0GHz) | Skylake/Cascadelake
| Hard Disk type	| Cloud disk, Standard local disk, SSD local disk	| Cloud disk, SSD local disk	| RSSD cloud disk, SSD cloud disk
Network	| Network enhancement 1.0/Network enhancement 2.0 (only Skylake and above support) and Hot Scale-Up	| Network enhancement 1.0 and Hot Scale-Up	| Network enhancement 2.0 and Hot Scale-Up
