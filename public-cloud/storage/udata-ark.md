# UDataArk
## Overview
UDataArk provides continuous data protection (CDP) services for UCloud local disks/EVS disks, and is an automatic data backup system that is completely heterogeneous with local disks/EVS disk storage, which can prevent data deletion or loss caused by mis-operation and hacker attacks to the greatest extent.

There are two important metrics for evaluating the capability of a data backup product: a recovery point objective (RPO), which refers to the point in time to which the data can be recovered, and a recovery time objective that refers to how long it takes for the business to go from stop to recovery at the time of recovery. 

The data ark shows its superiority on both indicators:

### Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
The RPO of Data Ark reaches the second level, and by default, it supports restoring any second within 12 hours, restoring any whole point within 24 hours, and restoring any zero point within 3 days.
### Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
The RTO of the data ark can be restored in as little as 5 minutes, and the amount of 1TB data can be restored within 1 hour.
