# UHybrid - Hybrid Cloud
## Product architecture
SCloud Extended Hybrid Cloud solution provides a wealth of IaasS and PaaS products and professional services, integrating SCloud public cloud, managed cloud, private cloud and customer-owned hosted IDC data center resources. It focuses on the rational utilization of existing IT resources to achieve multi-cloud interconnection and multi-region flexible networking. 

The flexible architecture meets the requirements of stability and smooth transition of cloud services in various industries. Safety meets the requirements of financial protection level 3 compliance; Meet the needs of scenarios such as active-active and disaster recovery in data centers. The result is a fast, convenient, secure and low-cost hybrid cloud deployment.

## Core advantages
### Global resource coverage
26 regions, 33 availability zones, and 61 data center data centers around the world have complete computer rooms with redundant power guarantee, high-level fire protection system and complete disaster recovery plans. Ensure the stable operation of the equipment and continue to provide reliable service.
### Go to the cloud with ease
Professional and senior architect consulting team, customized hybrid cloud solutions, meticulous and personal project delivery team, to provide project life cycle management, worry-free cloud migration.

## Product comparison

| | SCloud hybrid cloud | Traditional IDC | Build your own private cloud |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Resource | Possess Tier 3 computer rooms in many places around the world, accessing the multi-line BGP network of China Telecom, China Unicom, China Mobile, Railcom... | The coverage of overseas computer rooms is relatively small, and the access lines of the computer room are BGP lines such as telecommunications, Unicom, and mobile | The computer room cabinet has few resources and is difficult to expand, and the access lines of the computer room are few, and the interconnection between the computer rooms needs to be pulled separately Special line, long implementation cycle |
| Asset-light | Low cost investment, lightweight asset management, flexible architecture design | The one-time investment cost is high, and the elastic expansion ability is weak | With heavy asset investment, you need to build and maintain the cloud platform by yourself, which is expensive to maintain |
| Service and ease of use | Professional operation and maintenance team 7\*24 hours of service, unified management of resources, online operation It supports flexible server expansion and global networking | The online delivery process is long and the level of private management is uneven | Independent management, rapid deployment |
| Data security | Provide comprehensive security protection including tenant isolation, DDOS protection, intrusion detection, data leakage detection, vulnerability protection, etc Protection solutions to protect business data security in an all-round way | Support basic network isolation, open up the cloud network is more complex | To support tenant isolation, the overall security protection needs to rely on other security vendors |

## Application scenarios
### Smooth expansion of resources in multiple data centers
Supplementing the limitations of traditional IDC and self-built private clouds in resource expansion, SCloud's DC Group solution can achieve smooth expansion of basic resources.

SCloud proposed the concept of "DC Group", which connects Full-Mesh between geographically close data centers (DCs) to provide services as the same Availability Zone (AZ).
### Advantage:
Low latency: The minimum distance between data centers is less than 10 km, and the latency is less than 0.1ms

High reliability: Full device protection + rich network protection, network switching time is less than 50ms

Ultra-large bandwidth: A single fiber supports transmission capacity greater than 4T, greatly improving bandwidth utilization and reducing costs

### Multi-access point networking and construction
SCloud provides network services that can meet customer private line access to build a hybrid cloud architecture. Meet complex business scenarios such as customer service transformation, remote disaster recovery, multi-region service expansion, and multi-cloud disaster recovery.

Rich and convenient access methods, which is conducive to the migration of original services to the cloud: You can choose a variety of private line access solutions, and customers can access by themselves or choose a third-party construction access cooperated by SCloud, and support multi-POP point access options. The short opening cycle facilitates quick access to SCloud's own data center and can efficiently expand cloud resources.

Low latency, stability, and proprietary, ensuring high availability: Relying on high-quality digital links provided by SCloud partner operators, as well as 10 Gigabit interfaces and redundancy solutions, it can ensure the stability, security, and high availability of private line interconnection services.

Interconnection with cloud products and upgrade to elastic, high-availability and high-scalability architecture: Realize low-latency interoperability between physical devices and SCloud cloud products, and deploy hybrid cloud architecture. Realize the upgrade of the original business architecture, with an easily scalable, secure, stable, and elastic business architecture.

### Flexible architecture deployment
Hardware management, providing privatization architecture deployment, meeting users' own data security requirements, providing standard interfaces, docking multi-platform resource data, unified management
